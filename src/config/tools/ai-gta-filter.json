                "answer": "Our AI GTA Filter uses advanced artificial intelligence to transform your photo into stylized artwork inspired by the Grand Theft Auto series. It applies bold outlines, cel-shading effects, vibrant color palettes, and game-like visual elements to recreate the signature GTA aesthetic."
            },
            {
                "question": "What kind of photos give the best results?",
                "answer": "Clear, well-lit portraits or mid-shots provide the best outcome. High-resolution images help the AI capture facial features and background details accurately for a sharper, more polished GTA-style transformation."
            },
            {
                "question": "Can I turn a full-body photo into GTA artwork?",
                "answer": "Yes. The AI supports both portrait and full-body photos. For full-body shots, using a higher-resolution image ensures better clarity and more detailed stylization."
            },
            {
                "question": "What devices can I use to apply the GTA effect?",
                "answer": "You can use the AI GTA Filter on any modern device, including smartphones, tablets, laptops, and desktop computers, as long as it supports standard web browsing."
            },
            {
                "question": "Is my photo data safe? Do you store my images?",
                "answer": "Yes, your privacy is a priority. Remix AI processes your image securely and deletes uploaded files after a short period. Your photos are never stored long-term, shared, or used for any purpose other than generating the GTA-style output."
