                "question": "Will the added clouds look realistic?",
                "answer": "Our AI cloud-adding tool uses sky detection and adjusts lighting, color, and perspective to ensure clouds integrate naturally. Less advanced tools may make clouds appear pasted on."

                "question": "What kind of photos work best for this effect?",
                "answer": "Images with a clear or visible sky work best. High-resolution, well-lit skies allow the tool to accurately detect and enhance or replace clouds."

                "question": "Are my images private?",
                "answer": "Remix AI prioritizes user privacy. Our AI tools do not store images long-term and keep edits private, but it’s always a good idea to review the privacy policy."
            },
            {
                "question": "Do I need advanced editing skills to add clouds?",
                "answer": "Not at all. Many AI tools, like Remix AI Perfect, are very user-friendly. Advanced software, such as Photoshop, provides more control if you’re familiar with layers and masking."
